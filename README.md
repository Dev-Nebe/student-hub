# STUDENT HUB

## Introduction

This is my final project for the Udacity Full Stack Developer Nanodegree. It is a clone of the Udacity knowledge hub platform where students can request support from technical mentors while working on their nanodegree projects. I chose this project because I wanted to understand the design decisions underlying the backend APIs that power real world applications. Hence, my decision to replicate a real world application which I use frequently.

You can follow the progress of this project on Trello: https://trello.com/b/dnp5X41N/student-hub

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python). Python 3.7 is the recommended version for this project.

#### Virtual Enviornment

Working within a virtual environment is recommended whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/src` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Extra setup (I'll add these details soon)

- Auth0

- Postgres Database

## Running the server

From within the `src` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
flask run
```
